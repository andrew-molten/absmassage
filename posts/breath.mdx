# Breathe better

As a yogi, I’ve developed an intimate relationship with my breath over the last 15 years. Even so, I can easily be distracted away from it and forget to breathe well.

Breathing properly can lead to a healthier life – reducing infections, allergies, blood pressure, and heart rate. It can also improve concentration, dental health, sleep, and ease anxiety, fatigue, and stress.

## What does a healthy breath look like?

Experts say that **slow, spacious, nasal** breathing is the best way to breathe.

**_Spacious_** - your belly, chest & ribs expand as you inhale.  
**_Slow_** — 5 breaths per minute at rest (about 5.5-second inhales and exhales).  
**_Through your nose_**, if possible.

**_Spacious breathing_** uses your diaphragm, breathing using the muscles that are designed for it. It’s very common when shallow breathing we use our chest and back muscles to breathe

**Breathing slowly** improves CO₂ tolerance, increases blood flow to the brain, and helps lungs absorb more oxygen. The heart beats faster on an inhale and slower on an exhale, so extending the exhale calms the parasympathetic nervous system, inducing a more relaxed state.

**Through the nose** because nasal cavities filter toxins, humidify and warm the air, and enhance circulation. Mouth breathing can cause musculoskeletal issues — it often leads to jutting the head forward, increasing spinal load, and stiffness in the jaw and neck. Mouth inhales use upper chest and neck muscles instead of the diaphragm. That’s why **a healthy breath is deep and spacious** — using the muscles designed for it.

Breathe through the nose if you can — even while exercising. The efficiency you lose short-term, you gain back long-term.

## My favourite breathing hacks

### **Organise your body for the breath.**

Try this: slouch in a chair, shoulders rounded, neck dropped. Now take a deep breath.

Uncomfortable, right? Now reorganise into a shape that feels like you can breathe deeper. Try again. Better?

By reorganising for breath, you naturally improve posture. It’s a much easier cue than “pelvis neutral, spine long, chest broad, shoulders back.”

Just think: _how could I reorganise for breath here?_ You can apply this to any position — at a desk, walking, cycling, doing chores, lifting. Poor posture or tension can be a trigger to reorganise and breathe better.

### **Notice when you're holding your breath**

You’ve probably noticed you hold your breath during difficult tasks. It happens automatically — breath holding gives stability and strength, useful when lifting or exerting force.

But it doesn’t help when breath-holding becomes your go-to for thinking, or when you have to hold things longer than you can hold your breath. If your nervous system has to choose between breathing to survive or holding your baby (human, furry, or otherwise), it’ll choose the breath.

Breath holding down-regulates strength. If you can own the position from the start and breathe normally, you probably already have the strength.

So notice when you hold your breath and use that as a trigger to reorganise your body for breath. You’ll likely feel stronger.

P.S. This breath-holding can happen at the silliest times — like slipping into sandals or balancing.

## Other thoughts on the breath

It can be hard to access deep breaths during the day unless you’ve already done something that forces stronger breathing. If you start the day with some strong breathing, deep breathing later will feel more natural.

Here are a few ways to connect to the breath early in the day:

- **Exercise** – any kind, but spend some part of it focused on your breath.
- **Yoga** – breath is core to yoga, so you’ll find connection there.
- **Breathwork** – try Wim Hof on YouTube or sessions guided by breathwork practitioners.
- What’s one thing that you do every morning that doesn’t require too much brain power? Put a little sign up next to that saying “Breathe”, then every morning use you’re diaphragm and breathe deeply.

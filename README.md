# Andrew Bolton Sports Massage

This is the website for my massage business.

My original massage website was built with squarespace. I then rebuilt it with vanilla HTML, CSS & JS, but 3 years on I felt that it was looking a bit shabby, needed a bit of refreshment + I wanted to componentise it, as I had learnt more about doing that & was having to update things in too many places in the previous setup.

## The Build

I originally built this with React to make it responsive & easy to create the components. Then when I launched it was working great BUT the SEO was not.

So I investigated & experimented with a few different pathways of SSG (Static Site Generation). These included Vike, vite-plugin-ssr-ssg & react-snapshot, however none of these were particularly fruitful.

I decided on Next.js because I was interested in the tech, had a recommendation & was about to join a project that was also using it. When I researched it I also found that it would suit my situation well, I can use it to generate a static site now, & then in the future (when my bluehost subscription ends), I can change it to being a Server Side Rendered app.

            <h2>Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
            <p>
              Deep tissue massage centers on realigning the deeper layers of
              connective and muscle tissue. It aims to release the chronic
              patterns of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep
              finger pressure on the tense areas, either following or going
              across the fiber’s of the muscles, tendons and fascia. It is
              particularly helpful for continually tight and contracted areas
              such as stiff necks, low back tightness, and sore shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep tissue massage is much more than just a “hard massage.” In
              contrast to only relaxing muscles, the specific lengthening of
              fascia, muscles and tendons offers many benefits such as increased
              joint movement, quicker injury recovery, better posture, as well
              as feelings of well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep tissue massage is often used to treat chronic pain, limited
              mobility, recovery from injuries (e.g. whiplash, falls, and sports
              injury), repetitive strain injury (carpal tunnel syndrome),
              postural problems, osteoarthritis pain, muscle tension or spasm.

            <h2>Sports Massage</h2>
            <p>
              Sports massage can be beneficial for athletes, active people or
              anybody with tension. Often has a lot of overlap with deep tissue
              massage, depending on what you need, while also incorporating more
              techniques such as kneading, compressions & cirular friction to
              help break down adhesions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regular sports massage can help increase flexibility, realign
              muscle fibres, and restore muscle length, shape and strength. It
              can also be used to aid training to reduce fatigue, injury and
              delayed onset muscle soreness, allowing you to perform at your
              best.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tailor each massage to the individual, so whether you like your
              massage strong and deep or soft and gentle I am here to serve you.
              I use different techniques for different bodies, as every body is
              different and reacts differently.

            <h2>Relaxing massage</h2>
            <p>
              This is normally a whole body therapeutic massage designed to
              relax your muscles and joints, stimulate blood flow and calm your
              nervous system. You can of course still request specific area that
              you would rather focus more attention on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using long rhythmic strokes with pressure that is gentle, moderate
              or deep according to your preference. Unwind to peaceful music and
              relaxing scents.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will pay attention to your body as a whole, and will still work
              on any areas that are holding more tension, the difference being
              that this will be much more gentle than a deep tissue massage, so
              you can relax deeply. If the pressure ever gets too much, just let
              me know so I can ease off.

            <h2>Private yoga session</h2>
            <p>
              Are you trying to find more movement and/or mobility in your life?
            </p>
            <p>I've been practicing yoga since 2010, & teaching since 2016.</p>
            <p>
              Over that time I have learnt from many other teachers and movement
              experts. I've worked with the super flexible and inflexible! With
              people working on arm balances, and beginners just working on the
              basics.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you may have noticed by now I am passionate about functional
              movement. This flows into my yoga style too. The first thing we'll
              do when you come to practice yoga with me is figure out what you
              can do easily, and what you find more challenging, I want to know
              what your lifestyle is like, what' your movement practice is
              like?What are your goals? Then we will combine breathing
              techniques and yoga poses to help you get stronger and more
              mobile.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on what your needs and comfort levels are, the practice
              may be slow and methodical, flowy, loosy goosy, strong & powerful,
              meditative, fast-paced, zen & relaxing, or a combination of all
              these styles. Within yoga there are some general alignment rules
              to keep you safe from injury - I pay close attention to these
              rules, buut sometimes rules are made to be broken, once you have a
              good foundational understanding of the rules in your body then we
              can play more and more with how to break the rules in healthy
              ways!
            </p>
            <p>
              The benefits of private yoga are that you have the freedom to ask
              questions, there's nobody else in the room to worry about, you
              have more agency over what kind of practice you would like,
              together we can create a practice that moves you out of your
              normal patterns, a practice that pushes you and makes you sweat,
              or a practice that brings you that much needed relaxation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're practicing with me through winter or in the summer
              I will get this room to the perfect temperature for you, with my
              dual heaters for warmth, and windows for fresh air!

            <h2>Group yoga classes</h2>
            <p>
              {`I have not been teaching many group yoga classes, as I can’t quite
              fit them in amongst massages, family life & everyone elses
              timetables - but I hope to get these back up and running in the
              summer. They will be BYO mat as I don't have enough mats for a

              I can however guide private group yoga classes in the styles
              Vinyasa, Gentle, Beginners, Hot yoga (26 & 2) or Yin yoga. And can
              fit a class of 4 comfortably into the studio, 6 will work too, or
              8 packed in like sardines.

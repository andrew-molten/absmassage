              I have personal experience overcoming pain caused by various
              things. Massage & Yoga have played a huge role in managing my body
              along with many other practices. I believe that a variety of
              movement, strength & wellbeing practices are key, but that the
              most important thing is finding something you enjoy.

            <p>
              I started practising yoga in 2011 because I had a sore back &
              needed more movement in my life. I got my first-ever massage then
              too. It felt great to be looking after my body & over the
              following years, I got stronger, more mobile and was in less pain.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did a yoga teacher training with Tony Sanchez in 2014, then
              another 200hr training with Power Living Perth in 2016. I taught
              yoga in Perth for a year, before moving to Wales where I continued
              teaching while studying Sports Massage.
            </p>
            <p>
              {`I was massaging from home as part of the course & I just never
              stopped. We returned to Christchurch in 2019 & I've been helping
              people sort out their bodies since. I continue to learn from
              science & explore different approaches to massage, health &
              wellbeing.`}

            <h2 className="text-xl">Movement</h2>
            <p>
              My main goals are to avoid injuries, improve overall functionality
              & age well. I believe that having a diversity of movement is the
              best way to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do that I incorporate these practices into my life: hikes,
              yoga, mobilisation, kettlebell & bodyweight workouts, pilates,
              skipping, slacklining, climbing, breathwork, dancing, massage,
              self-massage, circus, cold plunges, short runs, sauna & rucking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our culture is sitting too much & so do I! I think we need to move
              more regularly throughout each day while thinking about strength &
              mobility.

            <p>
              I take care to create a cosy space surrounded by lush plants,
              natural wood & relaxing fabric in the ceiling. I always have a
              warm room for you & an electric blanket in the winter! Soft
              lighting for relaxation, aided by some very chill music.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love a good chat but also enjoy the quiet if thatâ€™s what you
              prefer, which often helps you focus on fully relaxing into the
              massage.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ambient environment helps get the best out of a massage.
              Especially if you can master relaxing the muscles being massaged
              with every exhale.

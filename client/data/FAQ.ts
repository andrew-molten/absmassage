    question: `Should I come if I'm injured?`,
    answer:
      'Not if you have been injured in the last 72 hours, then I recommend you stay in R-I-C-E mode (resting, icing, compressing & elevating the injury) to minimise inflammation and pain. ',
    answer2:
      'After 3 days your injury will enter the repair phase which is a good time for massage.',
    answer3:
      'Massage will help reduce stiffness, restore movement, and improve blood flow to the area to aid the healing. This is also a good time to start applying heat to the area.',

    question: 'How often should I get massage?',
    answer: 'It depends on you and your goals. ',
    answer2:
      'For chronic pain, it might be best to come weekly while figuring out lifestyle habits that will help you too. Then we can push the frequency longer & longer.',
    answer3:
      'If you feel stiff or sore and need a one-off massage, that’s great. I think you know your body the best, so after the first massage stay aware of your body so you can notice when the tension creeps back in, before it gets to the pain stage.',

    question: 'Can I exercise afterwards?',
    answer:
      'It’s up to you. Some people love to work out after a massage. I prefer to chill.',
    answer2: `There are 2 main factors to consider. 1: If your purpose of massage is to relax the body, you may undo it by exercising immediately after. 2: Massage may have relaxed some muscles so much that they don’t activate like they usually would.`,
    answer3: `If you want to exercise but are new to doing it after massage I recommend that you do so gently, nothing too strenuous. See how that feels, then you'll have a better idea for next time.`,

    question: 'How long should I book for?',
    answer:
      'At least an hour ideally, even if you have a small area of concern. Your body holds tension in other areas that will benefit from being released too, so you get more value from your time & money.',
    answer2: `Another benefit of longer massages is that it can take some time to drop into the relaxing, tension-releasing vibes of the massage. If you know that you're stressed or tight all over, go longer.`,
    answer3:
      'If money is a concern, you know for sure that you only need a short massage or you’re sceptical about whether I’m good, then book a shorter time.',

    question: 'I’m nervous about pain, will it hurt?',
    answer: `Don't worry about pain, I understand that everyone's pain tolerance and preference is different so I adjust my pressure for you and what you're comfortable with.`,
    answer2: `Sometimes in massage, we work with pain & the breath to help relax your muscles and relieve tension. I will often ask if the pressure is okay.`,
    answer3: `You can ask for more or less pressure at any time during the massage and I will adjust.`,

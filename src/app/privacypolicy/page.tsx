          We’re committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals that

          personal information. We may review and change this policy from time

        <h2 className="mt-2">Personal information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect personal data in a couple of different ways—directly and
          indirectly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal information we collect directly from you</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          We directly collect Personal Information if you book an appointment
          online and if you send an enquiry to us from our website, or get in
          touch with us by chat, email, or phone.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may also collect some personal information if you engage with us
          through social media. This information can include and is not limited
          to your name, gender, date of birth, country of birth, addresses,
          telephone numbers, email addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not directly collect any special categories of personal data
          about you. This includes details about your race or ethnicity,
          religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation,
          political opinions, trade union membership, and genetic and biometric
          data. Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and
          offences.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Personal information we collect indirectly</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Very rarely we indirectly collect personal information when someone is
          referred to our practice. A possible scenario would be when a
          healthcare professional refers a patient to our office and sends
          personal information about a patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          This information can include and is not limited to names, genders,
          dates of birth, countries of birth, residential addresses, telephone
          numbers, email addresses, a person’s emergency contacts, health
          insurance numbers, ACC claim details, health history, health status
          and patient treatment notes and records.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, in order to improve our services, we use data that can be
          retrieved from cookies, and other technology whose purpose is
          gathering data about website use. This data may include:

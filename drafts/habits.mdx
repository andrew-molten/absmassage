I've been thinking about the cumulative effect recently—after reading about the slow, powerful impact of building wealth in _The Psychology of Money_ by Morgan Housel.

And how that principle applies to so much more than money.

You don’t get strong from one workout, gain weight from one doughnut, run a marathon from one run, become an expert from one class, get overwhelmed by one thing, or relieve tension from one massage.

We are the sum of our habits—the daily decisions and actions that accumulate over time.

To thrive, I believe it’s best to feel strong, mobile, and pain-free. And that means regularly doing things that support strength, endurance, mobility, and rest.

### Rebuilding My Routine

Lately, I’ve been rebuilding my own routine, inspired in part by conversations with many of you. One moment that really stuck with me was someone sharing how their son now carries himself with more confidence and pride since he started running regularly.

I want that.

I’ve never been a big fan of strict regimens—I have too many interests and things I enjoy doing with my body. But I’ve embraced structure in other areas of my life, like Duolingo, and it works. So I’m narrowing my focus for now and giving this a go.

### My Habit Plan (So Far)

I’ve been nearly two weeks into this new rhythm, and I want to share it here in case it sparks something for you too.

A couple of key takeaways I’m holding from _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear:

- Start small
- Reduce friction (make it easy to start)
- You can miss one session—but never miss two

Here’s what my current routine looks like:

- **6 am Mon–Fri**: Practice German, then 10–40 mins of yoga, mobility, or general movement
- **Mon & Thurs**: 10–30 min run (with the long-term goal of reaching Castle Rock)
- **Tue & Thurs**: 60 kettlebell swings

One of the easiest ways I lose momentum is simply forgetting the habit I'm building. So I found an app that helps!

### Habit Apps

Right now, I’m using **HabitNow**. I love that I can be specific about the days and get reminders. It gives a satisfying red or green to the day, depending on whether I’ve done the thing.

I’ve also heard of **Habitica** for those who like gamifying their tasks and turning habit-building into a quest.

If you’ve got a habit app you love—or a habit you’re working on that’s giving you energy—I’d love to hear about it.

Let’s build toward feeling our best—one small step at a time.
